# Weather App
A simple website that fetches current weather data from [OpenWeather's API](https://openweathermap.org/current).
## Functionalities/features
- Get the current weather information from anywhere in the world;
- The background adjusts to the current weather conditions;
- Responsive design.
###### **Future Implementation ideas**
- Add a loading animation while fetching the data;
- Show a warning when the searched location isn't found;
- Allow conversion between units of measurement.

**Note:** to use the API, replace the MY_API_TOKEN variable with your own key or create a file where you can store yours like I did.
